Project Title: Full ERP API (v4)
Summary
Full ERP API (v4) is a comprehensive, secure, and high-performance backend system designed to power a modern Enterprise Resource Planning application. Built with Python using the FastAPI framework, it provides a robust, modular, and scalable foundation for managing core business operations.
The API follows RESTful principles and includes a complete suite of features for handling everything from user authentication and human resources to complex sales, purchasing, and financial workflows. With a strong emphasis on security and data integrity, it's an ideal backend for small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) or a powerful starting point for a custom business management solution.
Key Features
The API is organized into logical modules, each handling a distinct area of business operations:
1. Authentication & User Management
Secure Token-Based Authentication: Uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with short-lived access tokens and long-lived refresh tokens for secure session management.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Granular permission system with pre-defined roles (admin, hr_manager, sales_rep, inventory_manager, finance_manager, viewer) to restrict access to specific API endpoints.
User Administration: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user accounts, managed exclusively by administrators.
Password Security: Employs strong password hashing (bcrypt) to protect user credentials.
2. Human Resources (HR)
Employee Profiles: Link user accounts to detailed employee records, including department, position, start date, and salary information.
Dedicated HR Endpoints: Secure endpoints for HR managers to manage all employee data.
3. Inventory & Product Management
Product Catalog: Manage a detailed catalog of products with names, unique SKUs, descriptions, pricing, and real-time stock levels.
Stock Control: Automatically updates product quantities when sales orders are created or purchase orders are completed, preventing overselling.
4. Sales & Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
Customer Database: Maintain a comprehensive list of customers with company details, contact information, and addresses.
Sales Order Processing: Create and manage multi-item sales orders, which automatically reserve stock from inventory.
5. Purchasing & Supplier Management
Supplier Database: Keep track of all suppliers and their contact information.
Purchase Order Workflow: Create and manage purchase orders to replenish inventory. The system automatically increases product stock levels upon order completion.
6. Finance & Invoicing
Automated Invoice Generation: Create customer invoices directly from sales orders or supplier bills from purchase orders, ensuring data consistency.
Payment Tracking: Record partial or full payments against invoices, with support for various payment methods (Credit Card, Bank Transfer, etc.).
Dynamic Invoice Status: Invoice statuses (draft, sent, paid, partially_paid, overdue) are updated automatically based on recorded payments.
Financial Calculations: Automatically calculates total paid amounts and outstanding balances for each invoice.
7. Dashboard & Administration
Business Summary: A high-level dashboard endpoint that provides key metrics like total revenue, outstanding payments, and counts of products and customers.
Audit Trail: Logs critical actions (e.g., user creation, record deletion) with user details and timestamps for accountability and security monitoring.
Technical Architecture & Security
Framework: FastAPI for high-performance, asynchronous request handling.
Database ORM: SQLAlchemy for robust and flexible database interaction, compatible with PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and more.
Data Validation: Pydantic for strict, type-hint-based data validation, serialization, and automatic documentation generation.
Security Best Practices:
Rate Limiting: Protects against brute-force attacks on login endpoints.
HTTP Security Headers: Implements Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, and other headers to mitigate common web vulnerabilities.
CORS Configuration: Securely allows access from specified frontend origins.
Interactive API Documentation: Automatically generated and interactive API documentation available at /docs (Swagger UI) and /redoc (ReDoc), making testing and frontend integration seamless.
Potential Use Cases
The backend for a custom, in-house ERP system for a growing business.
A foundational platform for a SaaS product focused on inventory, sales, or financial management.
An educational project for learning advanced concepts in modern backend development, including API security, database management, and modular application design.
